## Features
- Show all the students in the DB
- Insert new student
- Delete existing student

## Instructions to build using Visual Studio
Change the connection string in App.config accordingly. Existing credentials have been changed. You can setup your localhost there. However, .exe files provided in releases are pre configued with my private database server. Therefor, they must work out of the box :)
